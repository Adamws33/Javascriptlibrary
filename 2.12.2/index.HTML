  <h1>Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask him to input again.

    The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
    
    Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h1>
  <script>
    'use strict';
    let i = prompt("Please enter a number greater than 100.","###");
    while (i < 100)
      i = prompt("Please try again! Enter a number greater than 100!","###");
